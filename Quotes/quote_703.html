But the jolly scene in the shed – our shed – makes it much less likely that this is a boy’s own spy story. You would have to have local knowledge of that rig-up; very local knowledge. It isn’t a bit likely that one of ours or one of theirs could know that. I suppose it’s just possible that the shed was chosen because it was secluded and a warm dry meeting place, or hidey-hole.’   ‘That would still entail local knowledge.’   ‘Not so much. Only that someone had walked through the yards and seen the doors. Perhaps actually looking for a hidey-hole. When it comes to knowing that the pig-killing rig is in that particular shed and how to work it, that really is insider knowledge.’   ‘Well, that isn’t impossible, Peter. Perhaps Superintendent Kirk and I were not the only ones to have worked out that pseudo-Brinklow was unaccounted for the night Wendy was murdered. And remember that two of her boyfriends threatened to kill her murderer if they found out who it was.’   ‘There’s a difference between making threats and being able to carry them out.’   ‘Let me think.

So he certainly passed the pig-shed.’   ‘Which would have been locked?’   ‘Which might have been bolted. The bolt is too high to be reached by the younger children, and I don’t suppose anybody thought of anything else.’   ‘There would have been nothing to draw his attention?’   ‘I don’t think so. But of course anyone could have said at some time . . .’   ‘Well, Superintendent Kirk is playing Pontius Pilate. He has washed his hands of it. He’s</p>
